ChatHead-Video-Youtube-Style
=============================

Demo to demonstrate the Video player like the new Youtube player !


This project just shows how you can play a Video on top of any app, I have tried to emulate the latest Youtube app, including the swipe to dismiss. I run a service to play the video whenever a particular video is selected.

This is just an extension to my previous Chat Head demo where I had demonstrated how you could get those tiny chatheads like the Facebook app. Only this time, I have gone ahead and replaced the chathead with an actual Surface View which plays a video. To stop the video, swipe towards right like in the Youtube app. This is by no means a production ready feature, just a small prototype and POC.
