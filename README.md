ChatHead-Video-Youtube-Style
==============================

Demo to demonstrate the Video player like the new Youtube player !


This project just shows how you can play a Video on top of any app, I have tried to emulate the latest Youtube app, including the swipe to dismiss. I run a service to play the video whenever a particular video is selected.

This is just an extension to my previous Chat Head demo where I had demonstrated how you could get those tiny chatheads like the Facebook app. Only this time, I have gone ahead and replaced the chathead with an actual Surface View which plays a video. To stop the video, swipe towards right like in the Youtube app. This is by no means a production ready feature, just a small prototype and POC. 


If you haven't read about my previous Chat Head demo before, please read about it in the links below. They should help you understand the details involved.
